# Proxy-Auto-Update-Program
The Proxy Auto-Update Program is an automated solution designed to fetch, update, and maintain a list of working proxies in a GitHub repository. Using GitHub Actions, this program schedules updates twice a day (at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC) to ensure the proxy list remains current and accurate.
